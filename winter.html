      How well I can understand that craving for work, oh God! I've never worked
      once in my life. I was born in Petersburg, a chilly, lazy place, in a
      family which never knew what work or worry meant. I remember that when I
      used to come home from my regiment, a footman used to have to pull off my
      boots while I fidgeted and my mother looked on in adoration and wondered
      why other people didn't see me in the same light. They shielded me from
      work; but only just in time! A new age is dawning, the people are marching
      on us all, a powerful, health-giving storm is gathering, it is drawing
      near, soon it will be upon us and it will drive away laziness,
      indifference, the prejudice against labour, and rotten dullness from our
      society. I shall work, and in twenty-five or thirty years, every man will
      have to work. Every one!

      In twenty-five years' time, we shall all be dead, thank the Lord. In two
      or three years' time apoplexy will carry you off, or else I'll blow your
      brains out, my pet.
