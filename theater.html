        <h1>Chase does Checkov tonight</h1>

        <h3>The Cherry Orchard - Anton Checkov</h3>
        IRINA. Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch!

        CHEBUTIKIN. What does my own little girl want?

        IRINA. Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch! I feel as if I were
        sailing under the broad blue sky with great white birds around me. Why
        is that? Why?

        CHEBUTIKIN. [Kisses her hands, tenderly] My white bird....

        IRINA. When I woke up to-day and got up and dressed myself, I suddenly
        began to feel as if everything in this life was open to me, and that I
        knew how I must live. Dear Ivan Romanovitch, I know everything. A man
        must work, toil in the sweat of his brow, whoever he may be, for that is
        the meaning and object of his life, his happiness, his enthusiasm. How
        fine it is to be a workman who gets up at daybreak and breaks stones in
        the street, or a shepherd, or a schoolmaster, who teaches children, or
        an engine-driver on the railway.... My God, let alone a man, it's better
        to be an ox, or just a horse, so long as it can work, than a young woman
        who wakes up at twelve o'clock, has her coffee in bed, and then spends
        two hours dressing.... Oh it's awful! Sometimes when it's hot, your
        thirst can be just as tiresome as my need for work. And if I don't get
        up early in future and work, Ivan Romanovitch, then you may refuse me
        your friendship.

        CHEBUTIKIN. [Tenderly] I'll refuse, I'll refuse....

        OLGA. Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven
        and lies and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks
        so serious! [Laughs.]

        IRINA. You're so used to seeing me as a little girl that it seems queer
        to you when my face is serious. I'm twenty!
