      Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch! I feel as if I were sailing under
      the broad blue sky with great white birds around me. Why is that? Why?

      When I woke up to-day and got up and dressed myself, I suddenly began to
      feel as if everything in this life was open to me, and that I knew how I
      must live. Dear Ivan Romanovitch, I know everything. A man must work, toil
      in the sweat of his brow, whoever he may be, for that is the meaning and
      object of his life, his happiness, his enthusiasm. How fine it is to be a
      workman who gets up at daybreak and breaks stones in the street, or a
      shepherd, or a schoolmaster, who teaches children, or an engine-driver on
      the railway.... My God, let alone a man, it's better to be an ox, or just
      a horse, so long as it can work, than a young woman who wakes up at twelve
      o'clock, has her coffee in bed, and then spends two hours dressing.... Oh
      it's awful! Sometimes when it's hot, your thirst can be just as tiresome
      as my need for work. And if I don't get up early in future and work, Ivan
      Romanovitch, then you may refuse me your friendship.
    </p>

      Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven and lies
      and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks so
      serious!

      You're so used to seeing me as a little girl that it seems queer to you
      when my face is serious. I'm twenty!
